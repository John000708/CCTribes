 ======
+Name: Tribes/Tribal Warfare/Landgrab/Territory
+
+
+Basic Idea:
+You are trapped on an island in a tribe v.s. tribe mode.
+There are two gamemodes to this, one being tribe v.s. tribe and the other being four tribes at war-ish styling. In the four tribes gamemode your tribe is allies with one, enemies with one, and neutral with the other.
+Different tribes come with different abilities/specialties.
+The tribe v.s. tribe will last 20 minutes long and the four tribes game will last 40 minutes long.
+
+
+LAND/MOB FUNCTION:
+
+
+Each tribe is dedicated a certain amount of "land" which the border of is marked with coloured wool relating to the colour of the tribe that owns it.
+Each piece of land will have a certain number of mobs in the colours of their tribe locked to that certain piece of land. 
+The mobs cannot move out from their assigned boundaries.
+Once the player kills off all the mobs in a piece of land, and the opposing player isn't on it, the attacker wins the land and the wool changes to the attackers colour.
+When a piece of land is conquered, defending mobs are then spawned that belong to the attacker to defend the newly owned land.
+This will continue until someone has conquered all land belonging to the enemy tribe and the enemy tribe main base which will be the land with the most mobs. 
+When this happens the enemy tribe is defeated. However if time runs out before one team completely eliminates the other then the team with the most land wins.
+
+PVP ASPECT:
+
+While there is PvE, as regards the defending mobs. PvP is also important.
+Players main role will be to defend with their mobs, or and attack and conquer land.
+When players are killed, they can respawn at their main base.
+They should aim to kill people attacking their land, to prevent them capturing it.
+When they choose a tribe, they get assigned a set kit including armour, a weapon and a special ability. Kit differs per tribe.
+There is a grace period of 5 minutes when players spawn in the centre of the map so they can find a tribe.
+
+UPGRADES:
+
+For winning a game, the winning team gets a set number of coins.
+The coins can be spent to upgrade tribe kits, upgrade tribe skills, upgrade defending mobs and upgrade the amount of mobs that spawn
+Perhaps also you can buy usuable defense towers that when you place, spawn a tower with a skelly or two in that will defend your land. If land is taken, tower is destroyed.
